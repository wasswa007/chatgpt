make sure you have python 3.11.1 version installed on your vps 
First, make sure you have an OpenAI API key. You can get one by signing up at https://beta.openai.com/signup/.
Once you have your API key, you can install the openai Python package using pip install openai.
then install telebot using the command pip install pytelegrambotapi
after in the code Replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN with the token for your Telegram bot, and YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY with your OpenAI API key.
This bot listens for any message from the user, sends it as a prompt to the OpenAI language model, and responds with the model's generated text. It uses the text-davinci-002 engine, which is the most powerful and expensive of OpenAI's GPT-3 models. You can experiment with other engines and parameters to find what works best for your use case.

when your done with all that, simply execute telegrambot.py
